# Tetris
Due to my extensive love for Tetris, I decided to create my own, add-free, version of the game.

Kind Regards MatRusTy - Mathias Pedersen

# Install
The latest release of the game is available for download on the 'releases' page:
https://github.com/MatRusTy/Tetris/releases

# Uninstall
Simply delete the tetris.jar file, and navigate to your documents folder and delete TetrisConfig.cfg

# Known bugs
- If your monitor supports G-SYNC, and you have ticked 'Enable for windowed and full mode', the game will run painfully slow, just like any other Java application with G-SYNC enabled. To fix it, simply turn off G-SYNC and restart the game.
