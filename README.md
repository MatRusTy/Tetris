# Tetris
Due to my extensive love for Tetris, I decided to create my own, add-free, version of the game.

Kind Regards MatRusTy - Mathias Pedersen

# Install
The latest release of the game is available for download on the 'releases' page:
https://github.com/MatRusTy/Tetris/releases

# Uninstall
Simply delete the tetris.jar file, and navigate to your documents folder and delete TetrisConfig.cfg

# Known bugs
- The game becomes weird when you play it on a <60hz monitor. Thank you Swing...
- The 'time' stat doesn't actually tell the time played, but rather the amount of times the game has made the tetrimino fall
